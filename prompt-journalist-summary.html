Include the author’s full name, birth year, and, if applicable, their year of death at the top as a headline. 
The summary should introduce who they are, describe the type of audience they catered to, and highlight key moments in their career. 
Mention both positions they have supported and critiqued, and provide specific examples of their reporting style or approach, such as important themes or issues they focused on.

Where relevant, describe how their work as a journalist connects with other aspects of their career, such as their fiction or public life. 
Include a quote from one of their works, with the correct citation.

Finally, provide a “Links” section with 1–2 links to material written by the author, formatted in Harvard style. Display the full URLs.

The writing should be clear and in plain English, avoiding overly formal language or interpretation. 
Focus on presenting factual information, allowing readers to explore the significance of the details themselves. 
Each paragraph should introduce key details and avoid summarizing the overall influence or legacy of the author.</pre>
